# Ingestion fatal

## Trigger

Manual reconciliation is initiated.

## Outcome

The run closes with error information and its partial counts; derived completion, cache warming and ordinary changed-data notification are skipped.

## Edge cases

- Replacement is per-file atomic, not one corpus-wide transaction.
- A fatal or aborted run skips ordinary success notification; a later successful run reconciles derived state.
